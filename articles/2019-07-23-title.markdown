## TL;DR:

In this article we're going to demonstrate how we can use **Flask** to build a **GraphQL API** that can create and return **flexible and meaningful data**. First we'll setup our backend using Flask and an SQLite database. Next we'll bring in GraphQL to build an API that will allow us to interact with quidditch teams, players, and games. Finally we'll demonstrate the value this graph-based database modeling can bring to our application by testing out two different **authorization models** to extend permissions to players from the Auth0 dashboard.

All code for this application can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/hollylawly/graphql-flask-quidditch-manager). If you want to jump right in, just clone the repository and follow the instructions in the README to run the application.

## Authorization Models with Auth0

In a typical application, you might have different "tiers" of users. Let's say you have a blog and a database of users who interact with the blog. The first set of users, let's call them `subscribers`, can only view public blog posts. Next you have the users who manage the blog and are permitted to see the blog's dashboard. Even within that set of users you might have `admins` and `editors`, both of which have different permissions. So how would we control who can see what? A popular way to do this is with **role based access control**. We'd simply assign each of those users the role of either `subscriber`, `admin`, or `editor` and then associate certain permissions with that role. 

This is a great authorization model for a lot of applications, but sometimes as your application grows, you might find you're creating **more and more one-off roles and permissions**. Maybe you created a subsection of the blog that only users who have been subscribed for over a year have access to. Should you create a role specifically for that?

> In our application, we're going to use our flexible GraphQL API with Auth0's rules to implement two other options for handling these more complex authorization scenarios: Attribute-based Access Control and Relationship-Based Access Control

### Attribute-based Access Control (ABAC)

Attribute-based access control means we're authorizing our user to have access to something **based on a trait associated with that user**. So in the above example, instead of assigning each user who has been subscribed for over a year a special role for that, we'd just look at the `created_at` field associated with that user and allow or deny access based on that.

### Relationship-based Access Control (ReBAC)

Relationship-based access control is where we allow access to something **based on how that data relates to other data**. In the blog example, we might want to allow a guest author access to the posts section of the dashboard, but **only** let them view and edit posts that they wrote. In this case, we need to **check the relationship** between a post and the user before allowing access. Usually we'll have an `author_id` field on the post that will link back to the `id` field of a user. If that relationship exists, we can grant post editing access for that user. If not, we can simply deny them on the spot.

So **what does this have to do with a graph structured data**? Modeling our data in a graph-like structure is a great way to bring flexibility to our data and really make **relationships** the top priority. As applications become increasingly complex, it gets much harder to manage roles and permissions. 

Think of an application as massive as Facebook. You allow your profile to be viewed by **your friends** and also **friends of friends**. Some user clicks to view your profile, so now Facebook needs to run a query to search through all of that person's friends and then search all of friends of those friends before it can authorize them to view your profile. That's a lot of work! By modeling these relationships in a graph, we can just select out any point in the graph and "hop" to the next data point to see that relationship. Then we just define [rules](https://auth0.com/docs/rules) that use those relationships or data attributes to make authorization decisions. That's exactly what we're going to do in this article.

## Why Flask and GraphQL

We're going to be using Flask as our application backend. [Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/) is a simple and flexible web framework for [Python](https://www.python.org/) that provides us with tools that will make our application development much faster and easier. Flask is super lightweight, so it's a perfect choice for a simple but extensible backend. 

We'll also be using [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) to build a simple API. GraphQL is a query language that allows us to create APIs or work with existing APIs. It was created by Facebook and publicly released in 2015. Since then it's been gaining a ton of traction from both individual developers and also big companies such as Airbnb and Shopify.

Instead of your data being accessed in a table format, imagine it's a graph. Once we establish what data points are exposed in that graph in the backend, we can use the frontend to pick and choose **exactly** what data we want and how we want it formatted. The client query dictates the response. 

Some notable features:

- It can be used with any language or database
- Can be used on top of existing REST APIs
- Gives the client side more control

## Prerequisites

Because Flask is a web framework for Python, we need to have Python on our machines. 

You can check if it's installed on your system by opening your terminal and running:

```bash
python --version
```

If a version is not returned, you're going to need to download and install the latest version from the [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). For this tutorial, we'll be using Python 3.

Next we're going to be using **Pip**, which is a package manager for Python, similar to npm. If you downloaded a recent version of Python 3 (3.4 or higher), pip should have been installed with it. If not, you can install it [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/).

You can double check if it's installed with:

```bash
pip --version
```

## Setting Up our Application

Before we jump into GraphQL, let's setup our Flask backend and then get our database ready for querying.

First things first, let's setup our project directory. 

Create a folder called `flask-quidditch-manager`. Then enter into that folder and we'll create our first file, which will serve as the entry point for our application `app.py`. You can do this in your terminal with the following commands:

```bash
mkdir flask-quidditch-manager
cd flask-quidditch-manager
touch app.py
```

You can open your preferred code editor now and let's get started with Python.

### Creating a Virtual Environment

Whenever you're creating a Python project that requires external packages, it's a good idea to create a **virtual environment**. This will keep all of our dependencies isolated to that specific project. If we just installed every package globally on our system, we could eventually run into problems if we had a scenario where two different projects required different versions of the same package. So let's setup our virtual environment now. If you're on Python 3, the module `venv` should already be installed on your system. If not, you can find installation instructions [here](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/installation/#install-install-virtualenv).

Make sure you're in the project folder `flask-quidditch`, and run the following command:

For Mac/Linux:
```bash
python3 -m venv env
```

For Windows:
```bash
py -3 -m venv env
```

This will create a folder in your project folder called `env` where we can store all of our dependencies.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hollylawly/flask-graphql-article/master/images/env-setup.png)

Next we just need to activate it. All you have to do is run the activate script that's inside the folder we created. In this case it's located at `env/Scripts/activate`. `env` will be replaced by whatever you named the environment.  

If you're on **Windows** use:

```bash
env\Scripts\activate
```

If you're on Mac or Linux use:

```bash
. env/bin/activate
```

Your terminal should now look similar to this:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hollylawly/flask-graphql-article/master/images/env.png)

Whenever you're ready to exit the environment, just run `deactivate` in your terminal.

*Note* - If you're using VSCode to run your commands, you may need to add `"terminal.integrated.shellArgs.windows": ["-ExecutionPolicy", "Bypass"]` to your `settings.json` file in order to run the activate script. 

### Setting up Flask

Now that we have a virtual environment to store our dependencies, we're finally ready to setup Flask! In your terminal run:

```bash
pip install flask
```

This creates a `site-packages` folder nested inside your `env` folder. 

Now let's setup a basic skeleton app. Open up your empty `app.py` file and paste in the following:

```py
# app.py

# import flask
from flask import Flask

# initialise flask object
app = Flask(__name__)

# Create home route
@app.route('/')
def home():
    return 'Hello world'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

The first thing we're doing here is importing Flask. Next we're creating a Flask instance called `app`. In the next line, we're creating a basic home route that returns `Hello world.` when called. This is just for testing purposes to make sure our server is running. The last line is actually how we'll start up our server. We're passing `debug=True` so that we don't have to restart the server every time we make a change to our code.

Let's start it up now to make sure everything is working properly!

```bash
python app.py
```

Now if you go to `localhost:5000` in your browser, you should be greeted with **Hello World**.

## Setting up our Database

Next up let's create our database! We're going to have three tables: `players`, `teams`, and `games`, so let's see how we can create those. 

### SQLite and SQLAlchemy

We'll be using [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) for our application's database. It's a lightweight database that's great for small applications such as our Quidditch Manager. While Python comes with built-in support for SQLite, it can be a bit tedious to work with if you need to write a lot of SQL queries. 

To make things easier, we're going to be using [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/), which is an ORM (object-relational mapper) that will help us to interact with our database.

In your terminal, run the following pip command:

```bash
pip install sqlalchemy
```

Create a new file called `database.py`. Paste in the following code and then we'll go over it.

```py
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
from sqlalchemy.orm import scoped_session, sessionmaker

# Database setup
# Sqlite will just come from a file
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///quidditch.db')
db_session = scoped_session(sessionmaker(autocommit=False, autoflush=False, bind=engine))

Base = declarative_base()
Base.query = db_session.query_property()
```

First we need to import `create_engine` from the sqlalchemy package. Next we're going to create our database file using `create_engine`. This is the starting point for our SQLite database. Then we create a session so we can interact with the database. Next we construct a base class `Base` for our class definitions (we'll use this later when we're creating our models). Finally Base.query is going to be required for making our queries later on.

### Creating our Models

Next up we're going to create our models. A model is a class that represents the structure of our data. Each model will **map to a table in our database** and include information such as the field name, type, if it's nullable, and more. We can also define any relationships between our tables in our model classes. 

Create a new file called `models.py`.

Our database will have three tables, `players`, `teams`, and `games`, so we're going to have one class for each of them. 

In `models.py`, paste in the following chunk of code and then we'll walk through all of it to see what's going on here. 

```py
# models.py
from database import Base
from sqlalchemy import Column, ForeignKey, Integer, String
from sqlalchemy.orm import backref, relationship

# Create our classes, one for each table

class Team(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'teams'

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = Column(String(50))
    rank = Column(Integer, nullable=False)
    players = relationship('Player', backref='team_name', lazy=True)

    def __repr__(self):
        return '<Team %r>' % self.name


class Player(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'players'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = Column(String(50), nullable=False)
    position = Column(String(50), nullable=False)
    team_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('teams.id'), nullable=False)

    def __repr__(self):
        return '<Player %r>' % self.name


class Game(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'games'

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    level = Column(String(30), nullable=False)
    child_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('games.id'), nullable=True)
    winner_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('teams.id'), nullable=False)
    loser_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('teams.id'), nullable=False)
    child = relationship('Game', remote_side=[id])

    def __repr__(self):
        return '<Game %r>' % self.winner_id

```

Here's the basic flow of what we're doing:

1. Importing the base class, `Base`, for filling out our tables
2. Define our three classes: `Team`, `Player`, and `Game` (note that they're all singular)
3. Set the table name for each class
4. Create variables that represent each column of each table
5. Specify any attributes required of that column
6. Define any relationships between tables
7. Define what get's returned if we call this class

These classes are basically the lifeblood of our database. When we create our database in the next step, it's going to setup the tables and columns exactly how we told it to in this file. 

Just a quick sidenote, you may have noticed in the `teams` table we have a `players` column that's using `db.relationship()`. This is how we create a **one to many relationship** using SQLAlchemy. All we're saying is that one team can have many players, but a player can only belong to one team. These relationships are important to define now so that we can model them in our graph later. You can learn more about creating relationships in SQLAlchemy [in this article](https://auth0.com/blog/sqlalchemy-orm-tutorial-for-python-developers/).  

## Creating and Seeding our Database

Now that we've done all that setup, we can finally create our database! In your terminal, type `python` to start a Python shell. We're first going to import the `db` object from our app and our classes from `model.py`. Then we'll just run SQLAlchemy's `create_all()` method to create the database. 

```bash
python
from database import Base, engine, db_session
from models import Team, Player, Game
Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)

```

You should now see a `quidditch.db` file in the root of your project folder.

Our database structure now looks like this:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hollylawly/flask-graphql-article/master/images/table-structure.png)

The final step before we move onto GraphQL is populating our database with data. We'll walk through the commands you can use in the Python shell to add data to the tables, but the data itself is pretty trivial and time-consuming to enter by hand, so head to the `seeder.txt` file in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/hollylawly/graphql-flask-quidditch-manager/blob/master/seeder.txt) to get all the data for this example.

Let's manually enter Gryffindor into the teams table. Go to your terminal and open the Python shell by typing `python` and then enter the following:

```bash
team1 = Team(name='Gryffindor', rank=1)
db_session.add(team1)
db_session.commit()

```

This is the process we'll use to add any new row into a table. We're just calling the class for that table and specifying the attributes. Note that we don't need to specify the `id` as that's auto-generated. 

Let's add our first player as well. We've already imported the classes, so we don't need to do it again.

```bash
player1 = Player(name='Harry Potter', position='Seeker', team_name=team1)
db_session.add(player1)
db_session.commit()
```

You may have noticed that for the last attribute we called it `team_name` when the column is called `team_id`. Because we've already defined a relationship between the players table and teams table, we can actually just use that backref we created earlier and assign it to the `team1` variable we just created for the Gryffindor team. That way we don't have to go through the trouble of looking up what id Gryffindor was assigned. Pretty neat!

To exit Python, just press `ctrl` + `Z` and hit `enter`.

## Getting Started with GraphQL

Alright now that we've setup Flask and have our database ready to go, let's finally play with GraphQL!

### Integrating GraphQL with Graphene

First we need to install a few dependencies so we can bring GraphQL into our application.

```bash
pip install flask-graphql graphene graphene-sqlalchemy
```

**flask-graphql** - [Flask Package](https://github.com/graphql-python/flask-graphql) that will allow us to use GraphiQL IDE in the browser
**graphene** - [Python library](https://graphene-python.org/) for building GraphQL APIs
**graphene-sqlalchemy** - [Graphene package](http://docs.graphene-python.org/projects/sqlalchemy/en/latest/tutorial/) that works with SQLAlchemy to simplify working with our models

### Creating our Schemas

Next let's create our schema. The schema is going to represent the graph-like **structure of our data** so that GraphQL can know how to map it. 

Instead of the traditional tabular structure of data, imagine we have a **graph** of data. Each square in the image below represents a **node** and each line connecting them is considered and **edge**. 

**Node** - A node in a graph represents the data item itself, e.g. a player, game, or team

**Edge** - An edge connects 2 nodes and represents the *relationship* between them, e.g. a player belongs to a team

Each node will also have attributes associated with it. In this case we can see some of the `position` attributes such as Captain and Seeker, represented as ovals. 

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hollylawly/flask-graphql-article/master/images/graph-structure.png)

If setup properly, GraphQL gives us the ability to **select any tree** from that graph. If we want to grab all players who are captains we can do that. If we want to grab all of the game data for a particular team, we can do that as well. GraphQL makes our data super flexible and gives the client more control over the type of data and structure of data that's returned to it.

But before we can start doing any queries, we're going to have to setup our schema with the help of our models that we defined earlier. Luckily Graphene makes this pretty simple for us. 

Create a new file called `schema.py` and paste the following code in. 

```py
from models import Team
from models import Player
from models import Game
import graphene
from graphene import relay
from graphene_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemyObjectType, SQLAlchemyConnectionField

class PlayerObject(SQLAlchemyObjectType):
    class Meta:
        model = Player
        interfaces = (graphene.relay.Node, )


class TeamObject(SQLAlchemyObjectType):
    class Meta:
        model = Team
        interfaces = (graphene.relay.Node, )


class GameObject(SQLAlchemyObjectType):
    class Meta:
        model = Game
        interfaces = (graphene.relay.Node, )


class Query(graphene.ObjectType):
    node = graphene.relay.Node.Field()
    all_players = SQLAlchemyConnectionField(PlayerObject)
    all_teams = SQLAlchemyConnectionField(TeamObject)
    all_games = SQLAlchemyConnectionField(GameObject)

schema = graphene.Schema(query=Query)

```

This is a lot to digest, so let's break it down. 

1. Import our models
2. Import our Graphene packages we installed earlier
3. For each class, tell Graphene to expose all attributes from that model
4. Create a query class
5. In the query class, define queries for getting all entries for each of the classes defined above

Let's fill out that queries section a little more so we can demonstrate how to resolve more complex queries.

Back in `schema.py`, keep everything the same, but add in the following code to the `Query` class:

```py
# schema.py

from sqlalchemy import or_

class Query(graphene.ObjectType):
    node = graphene.relay.Node.Field()
    all_players = SQLAlchemyConnectionField(PlayerObject)
    all_teams = SQLAlchemyConnectionField(TeamObject)
    all_games = SQLAlchemyConnectionField(GameObject)

    # Get a specific player (expects player name)
    get_player = graphene.Field(PlayerObject, name = graphene.String())
    # Get a game (expects game id)
    get_game = graphene.Field(GameObject, id = graphene.Int())
    # Get all games a team has played (expects team id)
    get_team_games = graphene.Field(lambda: graphene.List(GameObject), team = graphene.Int())
    # Get all players who play a certain position (expects position name)
    get_position = graphene.Field(lambda: graphene.List(PlayerObject), position = graphene.String())

    # Resolve our queries
    def resolve_get_player(parent, info, name):
        query = PlayerObject.get_query(info)
        return query.filter(Player.name == name).first()

    def resolve_get_game(parent, info, id):
        query = GameObject.get_query(info)
        return query.filter(Game.id == id).first()

    def resolve_get_team_games(parent, info, team):
        query = GameObject.get_query(info)
        return query.filter(or_(Game.winner_id == team, Game.loser_id == team)).all()
    
    def resolve_get_position(parent, info, position):
        query = PlayerObject.get_query(info)
        return query.filter(Player.position == position).all()

schema = graphene.Schema(query=Query)

```

So what's going on here? We're adding some more complex queries that can't just rely on the models above to display their data. For example, we're expecting GraphQL to get all games a team has played, but we haven't told it how to do that. We have to create **resolvers** that will work with our SQLite database and get that information to be added to the graph. 

#### get_player

This will allow us to request any **single** player by name. We're passing in the `PlayerObject`, so we'll have access to all attributes for that player. 

Now we just need to setup a function to **resolve** that player, meaning the actually query we do on the database to get them. We're just searching the `player` table until we find a player whose `name` is equal to the one we passed in.

#### get_game

This is similar to get player, except here we're getting a single game by `id`.

#### get_team_games

Here we're requesting data about all games played by a certain team. We're going to allow the client to pass in a team's `id` and from there they can request any information they'd like about games that team has either won or lost. When we resolve that query, we're just searching the database for any games where the team's id matches the `winner_id` or `loser_id`. Also note back in the `get_team_games` variable, we need to specify that we want a `List` of games instead of just one.

#### get_position

Our final query will allow the client to specify a player's `position` and then we'll return back all player's who match that position.

## Testing Queries with GraphiQL

Now that we have our schema setup, let's see how we can actually make those queries from the client. 

### GraphiQL

GraphQL comes with this awesome IDE called GraphiQL that allows us to test our GraphQL queries directly in the browser. This will allow us to test our API calls in the same structure that the client will use.

Back in `app.py`, let's create a new endpoint for the route `/graphql`. 

```py
# app.py
from flask import Flask
from flask_graphql import GraphQLView
from schema import schema


# initialise flask object
app = Flask(__name__)

app.add_url_rule(
    "/graphql", view_func=GraphQLView.as_view("graphql", schema=schema, graphiql=True)
)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

Your final `app.py` file should match the above. We aren't using that original home route anymore that we created for testing purposes, so you can go ahead and delete that now.

Make sure you still have your app running (`python app.py`) and head on over to `localhost:5000/graphql`. We can enter our test queries on the left and it will immediately spit out the results on the right. This is very similar to how a client would consume our GraphQL API, so if we ever wanted to extend this example to have a frontend, these are the queries we'd use.

Let's test out one of our initial queries now.

**Get all players with name**

```js
{
  allPlayers {
    edges {
      node {
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Think back to that graph of our data that we had above. To get all players, first we need to walk along all the lines in the graph (edges) that point to each player (nodes). Once we hit a node, we have access to all attributes of that node that were defined in our schema, which is this case is everything. Note that by convention, when we're making GraphQL queries we have to use camel case.  

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hollylawly/flask-graphql-article/master/images/all-players-basic-query.png)

> In a normal REST API, if you did a query to get a user it might return a lot of unnecessary attributes about the user. With GraphQL, we can request exactly what we **want**.

Let's look at another example to demonstrate this. 

**Get all players with their name, team name, and position**

```js
{
  allPlayers {
    edges {
      node {
        name
        position
        teamName {
          name
          rank
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This time we're going to request all players with their name, position, and team name. We're able to access `teamName` because back when we setup our models, we defined a relationship between `teams` and `players` where we created that pseudo-column on the `players` table. This is how we can use it now! Instead of just getting back an `id`, we can request the name directly.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hollylawly/flask-graphql-article/master/images/graphql-players-query.png)

**Get a single player with their position, team name, and team rank**

```js
query {
  getPlayer(name: "Harry Potter") {
    name
    position
    teamName {
      name
      rank
    }
  }
}
```

GraphQL also lets you pass in arguments. This time we just want a single player by name and we also want to get their position, team name, and team rank.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hollylawly/flask-graphql-article/master/images/get-player-query.png)

**Get all players whose position is "Seeker"**

```js
query {
  getPosition(position: "Seeker") {
    name
    teamName {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

For our final example, let's get all players, but we only want those who are Seekers. 

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hollylawly/flask-graphql-article/master/images/get-position-query.png)

**Get a game and the child game associated with it**

```js
query {
  getGame(id: 8) {
    level
    winnerId
    loserId
    child {
      id
      level
      winnerId
      loserId
    }
  }
}
```

This is a great use case for graph-structured data. In this scenario we basically have a sports bracket. We're asking for attributes of a specific game such as who won and who lost. We can also hop over to the next game node and see what the child (or results of this game) was and then get information about that game as well.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hollylawly/flask-graphql-article/master/images/get-game-single-query.png)

## Creating Auth0 Authorization Rules

As mentioned at the beginning of this article, there are a few different ways we can authorize a user to have certain permissions in an application. The most widely used one is **role based access control**, which is where we have a user and we assign it roles. The roles then dictate the permissions that user has. This structure works fine for small simple applications, but a lot of larger applications make authorization decisions that rely heavily on either attributes of a user or the relationships a user has to data.

Now that we've created our GraphQL API, we can use that flexible data to implement two different authorization models: **Attribute based Access Control** and **Relationship Based Access Control**.

### Creating an ABAC Rule

Attribute based access control means we're authorizing our user to access something **based on an attribute of that user**. 

In our quidditch example, let's say our application has special forums where all players that play a certain position can chat with each other. For example, every player with `position` equal to "Seeker" will be able to access the Seeker's forum and only the Seeker's forum. It doesn't matter what team they're on, as long as they all play the same position.

We can actually create this rule pretty easily through the Auth0 dashboard. Let's see it in action.

First head on over to [Auth0.com](https://auth0.com) and click "Sign up" to create a free account. You'll be prompted to create a tenant domain or just accept the auto-generated one. Fill out your account information and then you'll enter into the dashboard.

Click on "Rules" on the left-hand side. 

[Auth0 rules](https://auth0.com/docs/rules) are special functions you can create that will run whenever a user logs into your application. They allow us to add information to a user's profile, ban specific users based on certain attributes, extend permissions to users, and more.

Press "Create Rule" and let's make a rule that will extend a "seeker_chat" permission to all players with `position` Seeker.

```js
// See if the user is authorized to enter the seeker chat
// If so, give them chat permissions

function (user, context, callback) {
  
  const axios = require('axios');
  const name = user.name;
  
  axios({
    url: 'https://e709d1d2.ngrok.io/graphql',
    method: 'post',
    data: {
      query: `
        {
          getPlayer(name: "${name}") {
            name
            position
            teamName {
            name
            }
          }
        }
        `
    }
   }).then((result) => {      
      if (result.data.data.getPlayer.position === 'Seeker') {
        context.accessToken.scope = context.accessToken.scope || [];
        context.accessToken.scope.push(['seeker_chat']);
        return callback(null, user, context);
      } else
        return callback(new UnauthorizedError('Access denied.'));
    }).catch(err => {
      return callback(err);
    });  
}

```

First we're going to require **axios** so we can make the call to our GraphQL API. We have access to the user who's trying to access the chat through the `user` variable. Let's just grab the name from the user and pass that into our `getPlayer` query. Of course in the real world we wouldn't use `name` since that isn't unique, but this example is just for demonstration.

Next we just need to wait for this response and when it comes back, check if that user's `position` is "Seeker". If so, we push the `seeker_chat` permission onto their access token's scope.

Let's test that this works. Click "Try this rule" and we can run the rule with a mock user.

#### Our user before logging in

This is what the **user object** looks like before logging in. We have our user's basic information like `id` and `name`. Then in the next image we can see the user's **context object**, which holds information about the authentication transaction. Notice that the `accessToken` scope is currently empty. Click "Try" so we can run this rule against this user.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hollylawly/flask-graphql-article/master/images/seeker-chat-context-before.png)

#### After Logging In

Now our user is returned and if you look at the context object, we can see a `seeker_chat` permission has been added to the access token's scope.

#### Denying a User

Just for good measure, let's make sure that we're only extending this permission to player's with the Seeker position. Change the user's name to "Oliver Wood", who is a Captain, and run the rule.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hollylawly/flask-graphql-article/master/images/seeker-chat-denied-message.png)

The user is denied, just as we were expecting.

### Creating a ReBAC Rule

Next up, let's create our relationship based rule. 

For this scenario, let's say a user is trying to gain access to information about a particular game. And let's just imagine that the game results are supposed to be a secret to everyone **except the users on the winning team of that game**. 

We need to create a rule that steps in front of the user when they try to access the game data and checks if they were the winner of that game. We'll run the `getGame` query and check if the `winnerId` matches the `team_id` of the user trying to access it. This is the query and the data that we're trying to protect:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hollylawly/flask-graphql-article/master/images/get-game-single-query.png)

Create a new rule with the following:

```js
function (user, context, callback) {
  
  const axios = require('axios');
  const gameId = 8;
  
  // If no user, deny them access
  if (! user.id)
    return callback(new UnauthorizedError('Access denied. Please login.'));
  
  axios({
    url: 'https://e709d1d2.ngrok.io/graphql',
    method: 'post',
    data: {
      query: `
        {
          getGame(id: ${gameId}) {
            level
            winnerId
            loserId
            child {
              level
              winnerId
            }
          }
        }
      `
    }
   }).then((result) => {
        // Check that the user's team_id matches the winnerId of the game 
        if (user.team_id === result.data.data.getGame.winnerId) {
        // Add the game info to the context object, just to make sure it's working
        context.gameInfo = result.data.data.getGame;
        return callback(null, user, context);
      } else
        return callback(new UnauthorizedError('You are not authorized to see this.'));
    }).catch(err => {
      return callback(err);
    });
  
}
```

#### Before Logging In

Zacharias Smith is requesting access to the game data. He's on team Ravenclaw (`team_id` of 4), which matches the `winnerId` of the game. We expect him to gain access and have the `gameInfo` object added to the user context.

#### After Logging In

Zacharias Smith is in!

#### Denying a User

Again, let's check the case that a user who *shouldn't* have access tries tries to view the game. Harry Potter, who has `team_id` 1, should not be able to access this game.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hollylawly/flask-graphql-article/master/images/game-user-denied-after.png)

Just as we were expecting, Harry Potter is denied access.

## Wrap Up

We've covered a lot in this post and even though it takes some work to setup, I hope you can see the value of integrating GraphQL into your application. It gives the client the power to request exactly what they want and it also can help expand the capabilities of your application's authorization flow. We can simplify this even further by [using rules](https://auth0.com/docs/rules) in Auth0's dashboard to extend permissions or assign roles based on certain attributes or relationships.
